<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Established in 1983, the University of Hyderabad Campus School (UHCS) has provided an exemplary public education for the children of University Community and also to various other communities including the under-served in and around the campus, for three decades. The teachers and staff work diligently to make sure that they are preparing students to be successful and contributing members of our society. I am glad, the students are nurtured in a scientifically world-class rich environment, where the teaching and research is the top priority. The students and alumni have long been benefitted from this culture of high expectations and excellence. I am proud of many of its’ histories of accomplishments. <br><br>

I am sure; the mission of UHCS is to provide the utmost quality in education for the students by offering enriching opportunities to become leaders of tomorrow. <br><br>
I am delighted to be associated with the Institution of Excellence more so with the Campus School.<br><br>
My sincere best wishes to the Campus School Community for its unceasing successes in the years ahead.<br><br>

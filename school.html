<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was in the year 1983-84, during one of her visits to the campus that Her Excellency, the then Governor, Ms.Kumudben Joshi requested the University to provide some land on the campus to strat a school to be run by the Red Cross Society. Later the Red Cross Society expressed its desire to take over the campus school. The society donated an amount of Rs 50,000/- to the school. The then Chancellor, Justice M.Hidayatulla, formally inaugurated the Red Cross National School on 9th November 1986- a memorible day signifying the founding of the institution. The AP Red Cross Society later expressed its inability to run the school due to paucity of funds. The only option left to the university was to reprasent to the UGC to provide funds. On 31st March 1987, Prof Yaspal, Chairman, UGC, visited the University and sanctioned funds to the school. He agreed to include in the University annual budget reprasenting it as an expenditure for the welfare provision. Once the necessary funds were promisied, a committee, with the Rigistrar of the University as Chairman, was constituted to look into the functioning of the school. In the inagural year, the student intake was about 67 with two teachers,adding two more later.on the 4th of April ,1987, the executive council formally approved recruitment of qualified teachers to run the institution on a CBSE pattren up to XII.

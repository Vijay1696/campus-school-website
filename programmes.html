<p><h1> Pre Primary </h1></p>


<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLearning is an ongoing, wholesome process will be evaluated in a continuous and comprehensive manner. The Comprehensive Assessment process, at this stage, will focus on the daily, consistent progress made by the child in academic as well as co- curricular activities.<br><br>
The assessment procedure will be based on the child’s daily interaction in the class, his/her levels of general awareness, the quality of work produced by him/her, internalization of the concepts taught during the course of classroom interaction and the consequent learning outcomes throughout the year.<br><br>
The progress profile of the students will be sent twice in a year.</p>

<p><h1>  Primary </h1></p>
<p><h1>For Classes I & II</h1> </p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. There is no formal examination for classes I & II. The teacher will evaluate the students through continuous and Comprehensive evaluation (CCE).<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   The testing can be done simultaneously while teaching or separately. Most of the time students may not be aware that they are being tested.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. There will be minimum 8 cycles of CCE.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. One cycle of CCE means that all the students of the class are tested in all the competencies.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. they should obtain at least ‘C’ grade. If a child gets ‘D’ grade in some competencies, the teacher should repeat the cycle.</p>

<p><h1>For Classes III to V</h1></p>
<p>The CCE in classes III – V shall spread over two terms during one academic session.<br>
1. First Term includes Formative Assessment I (Pen Paper Test), Formative Assessment II & Summative Assessment I (Pen Paper Test), The duration of the First Term is from 1st April to 30th September in an academic session.<br>
2. Second Term includes Formative Assessment III (Pen Paper Test), Formative Assessment IV & Summative Assessment II (Pen Paper Test), The duration of the First Term is from 1st October to 31st March in an academic session.<br>
<p><h1> Formative Assessment:</h1></p>
Each subject will have only one Pen Paper Test in each term under Formative Assessment within the class & school time itself. The other mode of assessment must be a part of class room interactive activities. The assessment in the other formatives will be based on the following.<br>
1. Assessment of Classwork <br>
2. Assessment of Home work<br>
3. Assessment of assignments<br>
4. Assessment of Activities<br>
<p><h1>Summative Assessment:</h1></p>
